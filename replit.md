## 🔧 What Was Fixed Today

### 1. ✅ Token Persistence (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Problem:** User logs in successfully but immediately redirects back to login page
**Root Cause:** Replit iframe storage limitations + overly aggressive token clearing
**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced `tokenManager.js` with 3-layer storage: memory → sessionStorage → localStorage
- Added `restoreFromStorage()` method to recover tokens on app init
- Updated `App.jsx` to call restore on initialization
- Modified `Login.jsx` to persist user data in TokenManager
- Added `onAuthChange()` listeners for cross-component sync
**Status:** ✅ FIXED & TESTED

### 2. ✅ Missing Test Data (FIXED)
**Problem:** Only 1 user (super_admin), no tenders/offers to test
**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `backend/scripts/seedData.js` script
- Added 7 test users (1 super_admin + 1 admin + 2 buyers + 3 suppliers)
- Created 5 sample tenders with realistic data
- Generated 10 offers (2 per tender)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED & LOADED

### 3. ✅ Critical Architecture Flaw: Super Admin vs Admin SEPARATED
**Problem:** Super Admin and Admin were sharing the same Dashboard - violating Total Control Hub architecture
**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `SuperAdminDashboard.jsx` (Total Control Hub)
  - 4 tabs: User Management, Content Management, System Config, Monitoring & Analytics
  - Full صلاحيات التحكم الشامل (Total Control Powers)
- Separated `AdminDashboard.jsx` (Limited Permissions)
  - 2 tabs: User Viewing, Reporting
  - صلاحيات محدودة (Limited Assistant Permissions)
- Updated routing in `App.jsx`:
  - `/super-admin` → SuperAdminDashboard (super_admin role only)
  - `/admin` → AdminDashboard (admin role only)
- Updated Sidebar.jsx:
  - `superAdminMenu` with 6 sections (Users, Content, System, Monitoring, Profile)
  - `adminMenu` with 4 sections (Dashboard, Users, Tenders, Profile)
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

### 4. ✅ Error Handling (IMPROVED)
**Problem:** 403 errors immediately cleared tokens
**Solution:** Only clear tokens on logout, handle errors gracefully
**Status:** ✅ IMPROVED

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language and clear explanations. I want iterative development with small, testable changes. Please ask before making any major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies. I prefer that the agent works in the `/frontend` directory and does not make changes in the `/backend` directory.

## System Architecture
The platform utilizes a React frontend (Vite) and a Node.js backend with PostgreSQL database.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Design Principle**: All styles defined via `frontend/src/theme/theme.js`
- **Framework**: Exclusive use of Material-UI (MUI v7.3.5)
- **Color Palette**: #0056B3 (primary), #F9F9F9 (background), #212121 (text)
- **Styling**: 4px border radius, 8px spacing, Roboto font

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite 7.2.4 + Material-UI v7.3.5
- **Backend**: Node.js 20 + Express + PostgreSQL (Neon)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens + httpOnly cookies
- **Security**: CSRF protection, CSP headers, XSS protection

### Database (PostgreSQL - Neon)
- 22 tables created and initialized
- Connection pool: max 30 connections, min 10 idle
- Test data: 7 users, 5 tenders, 10 offers

### Test Users Available
```
Super Admin: superadmin@mynet.tn / SuperAdmin@123456
Admin:       admin@test.tn / Admin@123456
Buyer 1:     buyer1@test.tn / Buyer@123456

Supplier 2:  supplier2@test.tn / Supplier@123456
Supplier 3:  supplier3@test.tn / Supplier@123456
```
