# MyNet.tn - B2B Procurement Platform

## Overview
MyNet.tn is a production-ready B2B procurement platform for the Tunisian private sector, designed for scalability and market leadership. It offers a secure and efficient solution for B2B transactions, including tender and offer management, dynamic company profiles, and a complete supply chain process from tender creation to invoice generation. The platform aims for market leadership in B2B e-procurement by providing a unified institutional theme, enterprise-grade security, and a professional user experience.

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language and clear explanations. I want iterative development with small, testable changes. Please ask before making any major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies. I prefer that the agent works in the `/frontend` directory and does not make changes in the `/backend` directory.

## System Architecture
The platform utilizes a React frontend (Vite) and a Node.js backend with a PostgreSQL database.

### UI/UX Decisions
All styles are defined via `frontend/src/theme/theme.js` using Material-UI (MUI), ensuring a unified institutional theme. The design is mobile-first, responsive, WCAG 2.1 compliant, and localized exclusively in French. Loading skeletons are used for improved UX.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend uses React 18 + Vite, and the backend uses Node.js 20 + Express. Authentication uses JWT tokens, httpOnly cookies, 3-layer token persistence, and MFA. Security features include CORS, CSRF, XSS, AES-256 encryption, rate limiting, brute-force protection, input validation, soft deletes, and role-based access control. The platform supports multi-step wizard forms, dynamic company profiles, advanced filtering, messaging, reviews, direct supply requests, analytics, bid comparison, and comprehensive invoice management. Real-time updates are handled via WebSockets (socket.io). Data management includes export features, pagination, and bulk operations. A comprehensive email and real-time notification system is integrated. Super Admin features allow CRUD for static pages, file management, content backup/restore, analytics, service plan management, and audit logs. Automated tender closing, opening report generation, inquiry, and addendum systems are included. Offer management features technical/financial proposals with encryption, post-submission modification prevention, strict deadline enforcement, and digital deposit receipts. Offer opening and evaluation include decryption at opening, opening report generation, technical evaluation recording, and advisory final score calculation. Tender management includes award notification, a document archive system with AES-256 encryption, and tender cancellation. The system also supports partial awards with configurable winner limits.

### System Design Choices
An optimized PostgreSQL connection pool with `SafeClient` and secure query middleware is used. Security is enhanced with CSRF protection, field-level access control, and optimistic locking. Code quality is maintained through refactored and reusable components. Architectural patterns include `withTransaction()` for atomic operations, `ErrorBoundary` for UI resilience, and `asyncHandler` for robust error catching. Production code quality ensures removal of console logs, inclusion of Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, and enhanced Axios interceptors. A unified pagination system and query optimization techniques (e.g., N+1 issue resolution) are implemented. Secure key management is handled via `keyManagementHelper.js`. Validation logic, state management, and error handling are centralized. Data fetching is optimized with tools for selected columns, batch fetching, prefetching, and slow query detection. Database indexing is extensively used to improve performance. Initial bundle size, first load time, and rendering performance have been significantly optimized.
